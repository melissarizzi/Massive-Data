    "What stands out right away, especially for the purpose of our analysis, is that there are many missing values in the User_id variable. One possible reason for this could be that users who leave reviews but are not registered don’t have a user ID. Our goal is to identify baskets of items purchased by the same users, but without the user ID, this analysis cannot be conducted. We explored the possibility of using profile names instead, by assigning a dummy ID to users with the same name. However, we were aware that this might not provide accurate results due to potential name duplication. Moreover, there were more missing profile names than missing user IDs, which made this solution unfeasible. After considering our options, we ultimately decided to drop the missing values, as we couldn’t identify a suitable method to replace them."
